	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-02_6_Screeauk"		"To end Imperia's reign."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_2_Screeauk"		"Imperia KNOWS of the Kazurai now. She turns over every stone. Her spies are everywhere."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_3_Shen"		"She's scared. She realizes what the Flightless could do if they fought as one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_4_Shen"		"If I know my sister, she won't want a fair fight."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_5_Dragonus"		"She'll use the Queensguard to ferret them out before they're ready."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-04_6_Dragonus"		"And EXECUTE them for treason in the public square."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_1_Shen"		"So if we want the Kazurai's help to retake my throne..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_2_Dragonus"		"We'll need to find them before she does. And CONVINCE them to fight by our side."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_3_Screeauk"		"Exactly. That's why we must hurry."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_main-01-05_4_Shen"		"So where are we going?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_2_Dragonus"		"It is our wings. They envy us. Completely understandable."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_3_Screeauk"		"They hate you because your sister tortures and disappears them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_4_Screeauk"		"Once you regain power, princess, you must work toâ€”"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-01_5_Screeauk"		"Get your HAND out of my coinpurse!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_3_Meepo1"		"You mentioned cuttin' off a hand?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-02_4_Dragonus"		"That is where we START."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_5_Meepo1"		"The important part is if ONE of us dies, we're ALL kaput. Think ya can cut us a break?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_6_Dragonus"		"Mph..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-03_7_Meepo1"		"Or better yet, HELP us?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_1_Shen"		"What crime landed your brother in The Cage?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_2_Meepo1"		"Funny story. My OTHER twin brother made some bad bets with a Queensguard and didn't pay up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_3_Meepo2"		"And since we all look the same to these birdbrains, our OTHER other twin brother was the one they tossed in jail."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-04_4_Meepo3"		"Hey Meepo! You catchin' these birdbrains up?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_3_Meepo3"		"I solved it! We could just TELEPORT him out of jail, like."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_4_Meepo1"		"Nah, we can only do that up close. The Cage they're keepin' him in is way up in the clouds."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_6_Meepo3"		"Some nice wings you got there, by the way, lady. Bet you could fly CRAZY high with those things."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-05_7_Meepo1"		"Like up to a sky prison I bet."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_4_Shen"		"...there are hundreds of Queensguard patrolling The Cage. We would be caught as well."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act1_Dialogue_meepo01-06_5_Meepo1"		"Naw, I thought of that. While YOU'RE breakin' him out, WE'LL head over to the Midgate border and create a distraction!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_5_PakRajul"		"First of all, I very much doubt four guys dumb enough to summon a demon without casting a return spell first even KNOW how to kill me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_6_Axe"		"Wait. We were supposed to cast a return spell?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_7_Warlock"		"Ohhh. A RETURN spell. So if he proved too powerful for us to beat, he would automatically get sent back."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_14_PakRajul"		"Face it, guys. Either way you're screwed. So why don't you read the words backwards and let me get out of here before you kill me and curse the land even worse."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-05_15_PakRajul"		"I'm kidding. You would NEVER kill me. Let me get out of here before I kill all of you."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_warlock-01-07_13_Axe"		"Quiet contemplation was what got us in all the trouble in the first place. We were powerless against demons like this."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward2_2_Beatrix"		"But so ya know: They're REAL delicate. You're probably gonna bust a few before you pluck a good one."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_0_Beatrix"		"The second ingredient I'll need is a bag fulla DEMON BLOOD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_1_Beatrix"		"Now, the recipe says it SHOULD be the demon who stabbed him. But lemme tell ya, I've made dozens of these things, any demon blood'll do."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward3_2_Beatrix"		"I'll bet there's piles of dead demons from that battle you boys were fightin' up there. If it was me I'd look there first."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_0_Beatrix"		"Alrighty! Halfway there! Now the third thing I'll need is a PUFFBALL MUSHROOM."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward4_1_Beatrix"		"Unlike the cactus, these might be a little trickier to find. They hide under the sand."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act2_Dialogue_clickable-hunt-reward5_2_Beatrix"		"They're also timid little things. You're gonna have to sneak up on it quiet-like if you wanna catch one."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-04_Shen_2"		"Perhaps we could slaughter a bluehorn and crawl into its carcass?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-04_Maiden_3"		"Sure!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-04_Maiden_4"		"You'll certainly die quicker that way. They're FILLED with blood. You'd be frozen solid in five minutes."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_1"		"...I say let's get the heck out of this frozen death trap and take the mountain paths instead."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Bakeet_0"		"M-m-mountain p-paths? Is it w-w-warmer in the mountains?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_2"		"Ha ha ha! No, it's MUCH colder."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_3"		"But at least there's wood to burn and you can see where you're going!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_4"		"But first, let's cull a few bluehorns and make you guys up some winter clothes."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-05_Maiden_5"		"You can climb in the guts while I stitch up the hides, if you want."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-01-06_Maiden_5"		"A DRAGON?! Huh. I didn't know that, either. I think maybe I'll tag along, if that's alright with you two."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-01_Bakeet_0"		"Are dragons common in Icewrack?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-01_Maiden_2"		"Not if I have anything to say about it. Awful, fang-faced nasty things. We had one move in a few years back. "

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-03_Kestrel_2"		"The Flightless needed a hero and Kraw thought that was us. Everyone in Midgate thought that."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-03_Kestrel_3"		"They trusted me to train an army to fight Imperia... and all I did was get a bunch of kids killed."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-03_Kestrel_4"		"I don't want anyone else dying because of me. <br/>If I'm gonna help people I'd rather do it on my own."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-04_Kestrel_1"		"I disbanded them after the ambush. Made them go back to their families in Skywrath."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-04_Kestrel_2"		"Some of them wouldn't. They'd spent their whole lives fighting. They'd rather die than stop. They went south with Kraw."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-05_Shen_2"		"If you want to hide up here, FINE. But don't kid yourself that it's over. Your actions are still getting people killed, whether you choose to be there or not."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-05_Shen_3"		"Imperia has always treated the Flightless poorly. But mostly she ignored them. <br/> They were beneath her contempt."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-05_Shen_4"		"When you and Kraw formed the Kazurai, you made her see the Flightless as something else... a THREAT."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-06_Maiden_2"		"And instead of killing it, you just made it angry. Which sounds like it might be a pattern with you dumdums, by the way, but that's none of my business."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-06_Maiden_3"		"What IS my business is the lives of these villagers. You want to go off and help YOUR people? Super."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Kestrel_1"		"Used to be every night until me and Gralla showed up. We put up some resistance and it stopped coming."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Kestrel_2"		"Maybe we scared it off for good, but I doubt it. Probably just taking a break 'til it gets hungry enough to take another run at us."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Maiden_1"		"Well shoot, that's easy then! There's FIVE of us and only one of it! We just wait 'til it comes back, then team up on it and STAB STAB STAB STAB STAB!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Shen_0"		"It could be months before it returns. We don't have that kind of time. There must be some way to track it to its home and deal with this now."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_main-02-07_Maiden_3"		"If anyone knows dragons, it's OTHER dragons. And I DO know where ANOTHER dragon is. Let's go bother HER about it!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_2"		"There's only ONE woman in the realms who'd be that spiteful and destructive just to get my attention."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Shen_0"		"It sounds like you two aren't on the best of terms."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_4"		"What? No, I love her to bits, she's my sister. She's just stupid and I hate her sometimes."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Shen_1"		"Not that it's any of my business, but she's come all this way just to speak with you. Perhaps you could use this opportunity to reconcile?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Shen_2"		"Good point. So we're hiking to the top of that mountain to help you kick your sister's ass."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_6"		"No. We're going to hike up that mountain and listen to what she has to say."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-01_Maiden_7"		"And then she's going to say something insulting and then blame me for our parents never talking to us, and THEN we're going to kick her ass."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Maiden_1"		"I thought you were Lina! You don't have fire powers! How'd you set an entire mountaintop on fire?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Geraldus_1"		"Whew, it wasn't easy. It is REALLY hard to make a fire around here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Bakeet_0"		"We know."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Geraldus_2"		"But then I found a grove of everwood over there, and THAT lit up like nobody's business."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-02_Lina_0"		"Interesting. Because the Collectors have been following you since you LEFT White Spire six days ago."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-03_Maiden_4"		"What about that time you said I froze all the crops and we had to leave town? In the middle of the night, come to think of it."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lina-01-03_Geraldus_3"		"That wasn't a lie. You DID freeze the crops. I had to hold you up next to them all night. Insurance scam. Again, it sounds worse than it should without context."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_lich-01-03_Maiden_3"		"Or wait. Maybe the weights werenâ€™t magic, they were just heavy. Either way, they carried him up into the Barriers and dropped him in this bottomless black pool."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_2"		"...and nice floors so my feet wouldn't get cold, and windows so I can see out on nice days..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-intro_Threebeard_3"		"...and I made sure the cave walls were made out of wood instead freezing damp rock!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_act-threebeard-complete_Shen_0"		"Pretty good. How's the cave working out?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_token-trader-intro_TokenTrader_3"		"Honestly, for being dead I feel pretty good. How do I look? Mostly alive? I look dead, don't I?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Shen_1"		"It is time for us to head out into the Frozen Waste. Have you sobered up enough to reconsider being our guide?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_1"		"No to all of that. Who the hell's screaming?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Shen_2"		"It appears to be a giant angry porcupine at the other end of the bar."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_2"		"Is it the start of the month already? Dumb bastard's ship must have just come in."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_fighting-game-story-intro-long_Tusk_3"		"If that's who I think it is, you two should grab a seat, cuz you're in for a show. Is he running at me?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_match3-game-intro-short_WinterWyvern_0"		"Back for more? I can't blame you. Truly this game is a labyrinth of possibilities."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward1_Thrael_0"		"Welcome to the Library of Gorod. You will find every priceless manuscript, ancient text, scientific work, and historical document here, safely stored in these fireproof walls."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward1_Thrael_1"		"Of course, fireproofing doesn't come cheap. Not to mention the cost of all the priceless manuscripts."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward1_Thrael_2"		"So... *cough* ...donations are of course welcome."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_0"		"Excellent! You're back to make another donation?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Maiden_0"		"Yep. Why do you guys need donations, though? You used to have stacks of priceless treasures piled up around here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_1"		"Yes. It turns out all those priceless treasures did, in fact, have a very specific price."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_2"		"My master was... exceedingly generous with their pricing when she made me sell them all at the Frostreach flea market."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Maiden_1"		"Wow. All that to buy books?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_3"		"BOOK. She purchased a single book with them."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward2_Thrael_4"		"Did I mention donations are welcome?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_0"		"You're back to make ANOTHER donation? It's so refreshing to see lovers of literature like yourself out here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_1"		"We're such a remote library. Usually the only customers I get are constipated yetis looking for books on home brewing laxatives."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Shen_0"		"Why..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_2"		"All yetis eat is raw meat."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Shen_1"		"What..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward3_Thrael_3"		"Rhubarb and senna, I'm told."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Thrael_0"		"Back again? With ANOTHER donation? We might have to name a wing of the library after you!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Bakeet_0"		"Bakeet Bazura. B-A-Z-U-R-A."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Thrael_1"		"The Bakeet Bazura Yeti Constipation wing!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward4_Bakeet_1"		"Wow!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Thrael_0"		"ANOTHER donation? Lovely! Just lovely! And what is your full name, madam?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Maiden_0"		"Rylai Moon."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward5_Thrael_1"		"The Rylai Moon wing of the Gorod Library!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_0"		"Back with another donation? Excellent. You're such book lovers!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_1"		"I believe you are the last of your party not to have a wing named after them, madam."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Shen_0"		"Oh, I don't need a library wing named after me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward6_Thrael_2"		"Madam, your generosity is boundless! The libary of Gorod insists. Your full name?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward7_Thrael_0"		"You're back AGAIN? This is most pleasing. At this rate we'll be able to purchase new shelving for the works of the warrior-poet Xin."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward7_Thrael_1"		"His books are made of flame-wreathed magma rock. Very tedious to store."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_0"		"Astonishing. You have given so much, and still you return to donate more."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_1"		"Thanks to your generosity, the library might finally be able to procure one of the rarest books in the realms..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_2"		"The journal of the alchemist Jovat Kazran."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_3"		"I am told there is a spell contained within it that can turn you into a GOD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Maiden_0"		"Wow. Are you going to read it?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward8_Thrael_4"		"I mean... I might skim it here and there."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_0"		"I can accept no more donations from you after this. Your generosity is boundless."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_1"		"Thanks to your benevolence, we will be able to purchase the rarest books in all the realms."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_2"		"The Archronicus. The Book of the Infernal Maw. Perhaps even the fabled lost Book of Heavens!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Bakeet_0"		"Wow. I am DEFINITELY going to come back here once I learn how to read."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-reward9_Thrael_3"		"Our doors will always be open to you, Bakeet Bazura."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act3_Dialogue_dragon-hoard-complete-once_Thrael_0"		"The library thanks you for your benevolence."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Disciple_1"		"That is our holy enchanter's unspeakable name."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Maiden_1"		"Wait. You guys PRAY to Idrix?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Idrix_0"		"RYLAI! What are you doing here?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Maiden_2"		"IDRIX! I remember you saying you were gonna retire down in Skywrath, I thought I'd drop by and..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Maiden_3"		"And, well, I'll be honest, I guess I thought you'd be fly fishing or working on your memoirs or something."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Maiden_4"		"You didn't start a RELIGION, did you? It looks like these people all worship you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Idrix_1"		"Nonono, nothing like that. I'm not a GOD."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Maiden_5"		"Okay, whew."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Idrix_2"		"I'm just a CONDUIT to their god. They worship the Blueheart... well, THROUGH me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Dragonus_0"		"That sounds like a cult."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Idrix_3"		"Well, it isn't. It's more like a club that ostracizes you from your friends and family over time."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Dragonus_1"		"That is literally a cult."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-03_Idrix_4"		"There might be a cultural barrier here. Can I get either of you something to drink?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-04_Idrix_0"		"Yes! Exactly! That's who I'm the Conduit to! I'm the Conduit of the Conduit of the Blueheart!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-04_Idrix_1"		"Oh, I'm sure I've... mentioned it. Actually, the Blueheart was just telling me..."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-04_Idrix_2"		"...the Blueheart was telling the big blue dog that she should tell ME to tell you that we KNEW you'd show up here."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-04_Idrix_3"		"Oh yes! The Blueheart also told the Conduit to tell me to tell you that you'll have need of a powerful artifact."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-04_Maiden_4"		"Well, we ARE off to kill a queen after this. So I guess I COULD use one."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-04_Idrix_4"		"It is yours. But before I give it to you, I must know one thing."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Idrix_0"		"That's why I retired here. Skywrath is the only kingdom that doesn't have any."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Maiden_1"		"That's because there's an enslaved caste of flightless birds doing all the WORK!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Idrix_1"		"Yes! Exactly. And... that's not going to change? You're going leave all that in place?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Dragonus_0"		"...of freeing the enslaved birds. Yes. You can count on us."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Dragonus_1"		"Now about that priceless artifact."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Idrix_2"		"Of course! The Blueheart gives unto the Conduit of the Blueheart to give unto me to pass along to you..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Idrix_3"		"A staff with a true shard from the Blueheart Glacier!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Idrix_4"		"So you are! Looks like you're all set then, I won't keep you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Idrix_5"		"Remember, don't free the birds! Or introduce taxes!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01a-05_Maiden_5"		"Bye, Idrix."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-01_Dragonus_0"		"I wish I shared your enthusiasm. That is the Talos Gate."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-01_Dragonus_1"		"It is eight impenetrable feet of Ultorian steel. I oversaw its construction myself."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-01_Maiden_2"		"Well shoot! We've got TWO whole armies here! Couldn't we use a battering ram or something?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-02_Spoon_0"		"I could do it."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-03_Maiden_2"		"Well, as North Warden I get an annual discretionary fund from the Frostreach city council to keep the dragons out of Icewrack."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-03_Maiden_3"		"I'm SUPPOSED to hire a band of heroes to help me clear them out every year. But all the recruiting, the interviews, the reference-checking..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-03_Maiden_4"		"It's usually just easier to kill the dragons myself. I've probably got a budget surplus of... jeez, I dunno... forty million by now."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-03_Dragonus_6"		"GOLD?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-01b-03_Maiden_5"		"You won't tell them, will you? Technically I'm not supposed to kill a dragon without a party of six heroes with twenty years experience."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Screeauk_0"		"Because we've returned as HEROES, little one. The journey we've been on has forged us in the furnace of adversity."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Screeauk_1"		"Of course this humble village now seems small to our brave adventuring eyes."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Screeauk_2"		"The things those eyes have witnessed! The deeds they've watched us do! The dragons they've seen us kill!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Shen_0"		"What? I killed the dragon. The only thing you saw was the inside of a tavern, and that's when you weren't napping or drinking."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Screeauk_3"		"That's not how I remember it. I'm pretty sure I got the killing blow on the dragon."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Shen_3"		"We dragged the head back to the tavern! What did the rest of it look like? How many wings did it have?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Screeauk_6"		"Six?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-01_Shen_4"		"It had two!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Screeauk_1"		"Barely. It's pretty far away."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Shen_3"		"It is. And we will have to fight a legion of Queensguard to get there."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Shen_4"		"And even if we survive THAT, my sister will most certainly have a deadly trap in store for us."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Shen_5"		"No, we likely go to our deaths. But those deaths will be glorious, and for a good cause."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Screeauk_2"		"I've decided to stay here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Shen_6"		"Hold this sword."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Screeauk_3"		"Like this?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-02_Shen_7"		"Yes. Now move. Let's go be heroes."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_main-02a-03_Shen_3"		"Because you cast the same SPELL on us! You turned us both into wrath-wraiths!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_jugg-01-06_Kestrel_3"		"So if you've got a debt to pay, I can't think of a better way to settle up."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_jugg-01-06_Juggernaut_1"		"What should we do, sister?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_jugg-01-06_Serina_2"		"What CAN we do, brother?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-kez-11_Kestrel_1"		"Can we forget I asked about the army?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-01_Imperia_0"		"Dragonus. I give you ONE day to mourn, and you sneak off to start a revolution!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-01_Shen_0"		"No, sister. Dragonus used your leave to resurrect ME."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-01_Shen_4"		"You HAD me killed once. And I spent YEARS fighting gods and monsters to get back here. There's no one left to protect you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-01_Imperia_5"		"I don't NEED protection from you! Ugh! All this talking to a dead woman bores me... Did you leave your 'new friends' elsewhere? Why don't we meet some of mine?"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-03_Shen_0"		"Yes, sister. That was just ONE of your crimes. I'd get to the others before I kill YOU..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-03_Shen_1"		"But it's a long list and between MY laughing and stabbing and YOUR screaming and dying? We have far better uses for our time."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-10_Shen_0"		"The people of Skywrath will celebrate this day."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-shen-10_Shen_1"		"The day the reign of Imperia ENDS."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-dragonus-01_Imperia_0"		"Dragonus. I give you ONE day to mourn, and you sneak off to start a revolution! Have you come to apologize? To THROW yourself at my feet?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-dragonus-01_Dragonus_0"		"No, Imperia. I've come to reclaim the rightful throne of the TRUE Skywrath queen."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-dragonus-01_Imperia_1"		"Oh? Did you find one of the flightless rabble to lead you? You're moving on from my sister! It would kill dear Shen all over again to find that out."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-start-dragonus-01_Dragonus_1"		"Queen Shendelzare lives! I resurrected her myself. And she does me the greatest honor of my life by letting me bring her your head."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-low-health-generic-02_Axe_1"		"But you have to be a lot tougher than YOU to pull that one off."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-low-health-generic-03_Bakeet_0"		"Quick, find some food! Worms, cheese, a parfait, anything!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-low-health-generic-04_Bakeet_0"		"You don't look so good."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-ate-cheese-generic-05_Screeauk_0"		"A potent and timely cheese!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-ate-cheese-generic-06_Centaur_0"		"Yes, I watched Axe succumb to fried curd once. Though he struggled mightily, he did not reach the latrines."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-miniboss-started-generic-02_Axe_0"		"Whoa, that guy's huge!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-miniboss-started-generic-02_Centaur_0"		"I disagree. He is barely larger than a small giant."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-miniboss-started-generic-08_Maiden_0"		"Something NEW to watch 'em kill. Neat!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-miniboss-started-generic-09_Screeauk_0"		"Imperia sends you fresh meat."

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-02_Screeauk_0"		"You must kill Imperia or Skywrath is doomed!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-03_Screeauk_0"		"Save the kingdom. Save yourself. Most importantly, save ME!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-04_Screeauk_0"		"Years of struggle and it all comes down to this."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-04_Bakeet_0"		"Have fun!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-05_Screeauk_0"		"This is what you came for. Finish her here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-06_Screeauk_0"		"I hope you're strong enough... It's time to win this war!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-07_Gralla_0"		"Time."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-go-to-boss-generic-08_Bakeet_0"		"I knew YOU could survive! Now go kill that stupid queen!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-01_Imperia_0"		"I offer the gift of death."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-01_Maiden_0"		"What's the return policy on that?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-02_Imperia_0"		"You wanted to see the queen? Well, come closer, because here I am!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-02_Bakeet_0"		"I can see fine from here, thanks!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-03_Maiden_0"		"Torch this lady!"

	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-05_Axe_0"		"Kill her and let's get out of here!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-06_Centaur_0"		"If we cannot ride into battle together, I will at least watch you draw royal blood from nearby."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-07_Bakeet_0"		"You got this!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-08_Bakeet_0"		"I know you can do this..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-generic-08_Bakeet_1"		"But I can't watch!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-01_Imperia_0"		"Hello, sister. I would say it's good to see you, but I went through SO much trouble to kill you the first time, the least you could have done was stay dead."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-01_Imperia_1"		"On second thought, it IS good to see you. After all, do you know how great it feels to indulge in a little fratricide?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-01_Shen_0"		"Believe me, sister, I'm about to find out."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-02_Imperia_0"		"Shen, before I kill you again, I just want you to know..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-02_Shen_0"		"What?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-02_Imperia_1"		"I almost shed a tear when I killed you the first time."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-03_Dragonus_0"		"It's everything we dreamed of. Now's our chance."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-03_Shen_0"		"Dragonus..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-03_Kestrel_0"		"You two can get poetic afterwards! Just end this!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-04_Dragonus_0"		"This is it, my love. The last step to reclaiming your life."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-shen-04_Shen_0"		"For you, for Skywrath, for the DEAD! Long live the true queen!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-01_Kestrel_0"		"For the Kazurai and the flightless that rise from below! I've finally found you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-01_Imperia_0"		"Brave little bird. Are you always so eager to die?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-02_Kestrel_0"		"Hey, Bakeet?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-02_Bakeet_0"		"Yeah, Kez?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-02_Kestrel_1"		"I was just thinking how if you never got arrested by Imperia's goons, we might not even be here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-02_Bakeet_1"		"Sorry."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-02_Kestrel_2"		"No, what I meant was... Thank you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-02_Bakeet_2"		"You're the hero of the Flightless, Kez. You're MY hero. You got this!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-03_Bakeet_0"		"You got this, Kez! You're the hero of the Flightless!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-03_Kestrel_0"		"You're MY hero, buddy. Hang tight, I'll be right back."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-04_Bakeet_0"		"My market stall's not running itself. Kill her and let's go home!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-04_Pudge_0"		"This market stall, you sell RANCID meat?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-kez-04_Bakeet_1"		"Gosh, I got all kinds!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-01_Screeauk_0"		"Be careful, Dragonus. Her powers rival a god's now... We have no idea what she can do."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-01_Dragonus_0"		"Whatever she unleashes, it won't be enough."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-01_Imperia_0"		"Welcome home, Dragonus. I've MISSED you."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-02_Axe_0"		"Kill her and let's get out of here!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-02_Dragonus_0"		"I've told you, we wish to rule this kingdom! It is Shen's birthright."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-02_Axe_1"		"Then kill her so the REST OF US can get out of here!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-02_Centaur_0"		"Yes, this victory must be followed by a mighty feast!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-03_Shen_0"		"Come back to me alive, my love. I know how awful it feels to be dead."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-03_Dragonus_0"		"I would die a thousand deaths to rid you of Imperia."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-03_Shen_1"		"I only need ONE death. Hers."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-04_Shen_0"		"Be careful, Dragonus."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-started-dragonus-04_Dragonus_0"		"I've already won as long as you're alive."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-01_Axe_0"		"Watch out!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-01_Bakeet_0"		"I CAN'T watch!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-01_Centaur_0"		"Do not fear, little bird. He was not talking to you. He was talking to your friend who's about to die."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-01_Bakeet_1"		"Okay, whew!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-02_Imperia_0"		"Taste true power!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-02_Pudge_0"		"You can save ME a bit. I like tastin' things too!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-03_Screeauk_0"		"Watch out for her attacks!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-03_Bakeet_0"		"Everybody duck!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-03_Bakeet_1"		"Oh wait, the rest of us are probably fine over here."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-04_Spleen_0"		"She's using a special power!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-04_Spoon_0"		"Uh oh."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-04_Squee_0"		"Goggles, everyone!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-05_Imperia_0"		"ALL of you will die!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-05_Centaur_0"		"There is no greater honor than to fall in combat."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-05_Bakeet_0"		"Really? Honor sounds kind of dumb."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-06_Imperia_0"		"I don't need Skywrath anymore. Let the city CRUMBLE!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-07_Imperia_0"		"Get out of my Nest!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-08_Imperia_0"		"We do not approve!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-09_Imperia_0"		"Careful, it's a very long drop!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-boss-ability-generic-10_Imperia_0"		"So THIS is what a god feels like!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-01_Imperia_0"		"I win."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-02_Imperia_0"		"You came all that way just to die."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-03_Imperia_0"		"There are some timely openings in my Queensguard... but you failed the audition."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-04_Imperia_0"		"You know the old wisdom about coming at the queen? You missed."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-05_Maiden_0"		"Remember when I said this plan sucked?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-06_Maiden_0"		"Someone get a healer!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-06_Spleen_0"		"Someone get a cart!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-06_Pudge_0"		"Someone get my apron!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-07_Screeauk_0"		"Well, there goes my godhood."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-07_Bakeet_0"		"And our friend!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-07_Screeauk_1"		"That's sad too. But there's only ONE thing you can do in times like this: try to kill Imperia again. Immediately. Not YOU specifically, Bakeet. You're my last follower."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-07_Bakeet_1"		"But I brought my cleaver and everything..."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-08_Axe_0"		"What is that idiot DOING?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-08_Centaur_0"		"I believe the strategy is called 'playing dead'. It is a well known ploy of cowards and children."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-08_Axe_1"		"It's a convincing act!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-lose-game-08_Bakeet_0"		"Boy, is Imperia in for a surprise!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-01_Axe_0"		"We DID it!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-01_Centaur_0"		"Yes, we all share in the glories of this victorious, bloodsoaked day. Surely ours are deeds worthy of esteem only belts can recognize."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-01_Maiden_0"		"Perfect. Belts for everyone!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-01_Bakeet_0"		"Even me?"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-01_Kestrel_0"		"Especially you, buddy. I'd still be up in Icewrack if it weren't for you. You're the linchpin, the glue!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-02_Imperia_0"		"Impossible!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-02_Maiden_0"		"Nothing's impossible with the power of friendship!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-02_Screeauk_0"		"Or the power of Scree'Auk, as it happens. So chop chop, let's get those people back to worshipping me."
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-03_Imperia_0"		"Noooo!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-03_Screeauk_0"		"Yesssss!"
	"DOTA_VisualNovel_act4_Dialogue_survivors-win-game-03_Maiden_0"		"Those guidebooks were right. The Nest of Thorns is really neat!"
