		"dota_tip_hero_puck_2"				"Phase Shift allows Puck to safely wait for Illusory Orb's traversal or Blink Dagger's damage cooldown and move instantaneously without allowing the opponents to react."
		"dota_tip_hero_puck_5"				"Puck has many area of effect abilities, and it is crucial to stay spread out when playing on the opposite team."
		"dota_tip_hero_puck_6"				"With Puck's defensive abilities having very little cast time, the opposing team may choose to initiate onto Puck quickly with items like Blink Dagger or Shadow Blade."

		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_1"				"Pudge's Dismember ability is channeled and can be interrupted with a silence or stun."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_2"				"Pudge often relies on attacking from unexpected angles. Having adequate vision with observer wards will greatly increase the survivability of the enemy team."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_3"				"Pudge can use his Meat Hook to bring runes to take for himself or leaving them in a safe location for his allies."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_4"				"Pudge's Meat Hook pierces debuff immunity, allowing him to relocate debuff immune enemies and interrupt their channeling abilities."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_5"				"Pudge's Rot deals magical damage to himself as well as his opponent. He often chooses to invest in items that provide magic resistance to mitigate damage to himself."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_6"				"Pudge can use his Meat Hook to pull his allies to safety without damaging them."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_8"				"Meat Hook's and Dismember's audio effects can be heard through the fog of war, which allows his enemies to guess what the Pudge is currently doing."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_10"			"Pudge has naturally low armor, and any physical attacks, especially paired with armor-reducing abilities, can prove to be fatal to the hero."
		"dota_tip_hero_pudge_11"			"If your hero lacks a stun or a silence to stop Pudge from Dismembering an ally, a strong dispel like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield or Legion Commander's Press the Attack on the ally will also do the trick."

		"dota_tip_hero_pugna_1"				"Pugna's Nether Blast ability deals half damage to structures."

		"dota_tip_hero_queenofpain_1"		"Queen of Pain's Sonic Wave deals pure damage, which cannot be mitigated with magic resistance. It also pierces debuff immunity."

		"dota_tip_hero_rattletrap_1"		"Silences, stuns and banishes will not stop Clockwerk's Battery Assault: the only way to stop it prematurely is killing Clockwerk."
		"dota_tip_hero_rattletrap_2"		"Clockwerk's Hookshot stuns opponents for a substantial amount of time, giving him time to reposition and strategically place his Power Cogs, pushing the enemy in the desired direction and disabling them further."
		"dota_tip_hero_rattletrap_3"		"You can escape from Clockwerk's Power Cogs with a Force Staff, however you will trigger the closest cog's knockback and mana burn while traveling through them."
		"dota_tip_hero_rattletrap_4"		"Hookshot will pull Clockwerk to any unit, enemy or ally, which can be an effective way to escape."
		"dota_tip_hero_rattletrap_5"		"Enemies with long cast times, channeling spells or low attack speeds may be prevented from acting completely if isolated against Clockwerk's Battery Assault."
		"dota_tip_hero_rattletrap_6"		"Clockwerk's Rocket Flare is very useful for scouting enemy movements or slowly pushing lanes that are far away from the team."

		"dota_tip_hero_razor_1"				"Razor's Plasma Field ability does more damage the further away a target is."
		"dota_tip_hero_razor_2"				"Plasma Field provides vision to Razor, allowing him to look for enemies hiding in the trees or uphill."
		"dota_tip_hero_razor_3"				"Razor's Static Link cannot be dispelled or mitigated through traditional means, making it imperative to break the link by moving out of Razor's range as quickly as possible."
		"dota_tip_hero_razor_4"				"While Razor's Static Link does not provide True Sight on the target, Razor can still track the linked target's movements through invisibility."
		"dota_tip_hero_razor_5"				"Razor relies on his fast movement speed to keep up to enemies that he is damaging with Eye of the Storm or draining with Static Link. Items that prevent him from moving, such as Rod of Atos, may be a good way of dealing with him."
		"dota_tip_hero_razor_6"				"Razor's Eye of the Storm will prioritize targets that are being drained with Static Link."
		"dota_tip_hero_razor_7"				"Casting a second Eye of the Storm with Refresher Orb or Refresher Shard creates a second Storm, doubling his Eye of the Storm damage."

		"dota_tip_hero_riki_1"				"Riki is invulnerable and invisible during Tricks of the Trade, and cannot be revealed with True Sight during this spell."

		"dota_tip_hero_rubick_1"			"Rubick can cast stolen spells with relatively low cast time, even if the original caster's cast times are very long (with very few exceptions)."

		"dota_tip_hero_sand_king_1"			"Sand King's Epicenter ability will continue to pulse for the full duration, even if Sand King himself dies."
		"dota_tip_hero_sand_king_2"			"Sand King can use Sand Storm and Burrowstrike to disjoint and outmaneuver enemies by going invisible and going under impassable terrain."
		"dota_tip_hero_sand_king_3"			"Carrying means of detection, like Dust of Appearance, can be very important when trying to catch Sand King during Sand Storm."
		"dota_tip_hero_sand_king_4"			"Sand King can apply Caustic Finale to many units at once, something that may result in a massive amount of damage when triggered."

		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_demon_1" 		"Shadow Demon's Disseminate can be cast on an ally or an enemy."

		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_fiend_1"		"Shadow Fiend will cast a free Requiem of Souls of his current level upon his death, even if the ability is on cooldown. However, it will be slightly weaker since he loses a part of his souls before the cast."
		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_fiend_2"		"Shadow Fiend's Necromastery is instrumental in his damage output. After dying, Shadow Fiend will be substantially weaker until he regains his lost souls."
		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_fiend_3"		"Shadow Fiend is adept at killing creeps and neutrals very quickly. Denying him opportunities to do so greatly hinders his effectiveness later in the game."
		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_fiend_4"		"Shadow Fiend suffers from a relatively low health pool and mobility. He may be a priority target to burst damage based enemies."
		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_fiend_5"		"Shadow Fiend's Requiem of Souls has a long cast time. Shadow Fiend can cancel it prematurely for better positioning or timing, while his enemies can interrupt it during the cast. Casting Requiem of Souls does not put it on cooldown until it has been fully cast."
		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_fiend_6"		"An immense damage output can mean that Shadow Fiend may be susceptible to Blade Mail used by the enemy team."

		"dota_tip_hero_shadow_shaman_1"		"Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards are not affected by damage block, for example from a Crimson Guard."

		"dota_tip_hero_shredder_1"			"When Timbersaw is affected by Break, he will not gain additional stacks of Reactive Armor, but existing stacks will continue to provide armor and health regen."

		"dota_tip_hero_skeleton_king_1"		"Wraith King's Reincarnate will trigger even if Wraith King is affected by Break. It will not trigger if Wraith King has insufficient mana. Aghanim's Shard reduces the mana cost to 0."

		"dota_tip_hero_skywrath_mage_1"		"Skywrath Mage's Arcane Bolt does substantially more damage based on Skywrath's intelligence."

		"dota_tip_hero_slardar_1"			"Slardar's Corrosive Haze provides True Sight and vision of the target."

		"dota_tip_hero_slark_1"				"While Slark is under the effect of Shadow Dance, he cannot be revealed by True Sight."

		"dota_tip_hero_sniper_1"			"Sniper's Shrapnel does not affect buildings.  Multiple Shrapnel effects do not stack on the same target."

		"dota_tip_hero_spectre_1"			"Spectre's Dispersion reflects part of the damage taken to every enemy around them as the same damage type. It reflects more damage to units which are closer to Spectre, and having more units around her does not reduce the amount of damage a single enemy takes."

		"dota_tip_hero_spirit_breaker_1"	"Spirit Breaker's Charge of Darkness ability can be used to trigger an enemy's Linken's Sphere at any range, so long as Spirit Breaker has vision of the target."

		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_1"		"Silence can be effective at locking down an evasive Storm Spirit."
		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_2"		"Storm Spirit is invulnerable during Ball Lightning, allowing him to evade and disjoint many stuns and attacks."
		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_3"		"Storm Spirit can use items and abilities during Ball Lightning, which is especially useful when initiating on unsuspecting enemies or trying to teleport back to base."
		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_4"		"Overload is applied after Storm Spirit uses any of his abilities, including Ball Lightning. Attacking after every ability use maximizes Storm Spirit's damage output."
		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_5"		"Ball Lightning is not only a superb mobility tool, but is a great source of damage when used from a long distance. Making sure an enemy gets hit by a long initiation is an important component of Storm Spirit's damage output."
		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_6"		"Storm Spirit is very dependent on having mana to fight. Items and abilities that attack his mana pool, such as Diffusal Blade or Nyx Assassin's Vendetta, can be devastating for Storm Spirit."
		"dota_tip_hero_storm_spirit_7"		"Storm Spirit's invulnerability during Ball Lightning means that he can completely ignore most negative effects from movement-based spells, such as Bloodseeker's Rupture."

		"dota_tip_hero_sven_1"				"Sven's Great Cleave deals physical damage in an area behind his attack target. The damage is mitigated by armor."
		"dota_tip_hero_sven_2"				"Sven's Warcry grants him and his allies increased movement speed and armor."
		"dota_tip_hero_sven_3"				"Sven relies on being close to enemies to deal massive amounts of damage. Limiting his mobility with items like Rod of Atos or abilities like Nature's Prophet's Sprout is great for mitigating his damage during God's Strength."
		"dota_tip_hero_sven_4"				"Most of Sven's damage comes from his physical attacks and can be prevented with disarms, like from Heaven's Halberd."
		"dota_tip_hero_sven_5"				"Avoiding Sven's attacks with sources of evasion, such as Butterfly or Heaven's Halberd, or being physically immune, for example with Ghost Scepter, are effective ways of surviving Sven's damage."
		"dota_tip_hero_sven_6"				"Sven's God's Strength can be useful not only in team fights, but also taking objectives like killing enemy towers or Roshan."

		"dota_tip_hero_techies_2"			"Techies' Blast Off ability can be interrupted by applying forced movement effects (like Force Staff or Rubick's Telekinesis) on Techies during the jump."

		"dota_tip_hero_templar_assassin_1"	"Templar Assassin's Refraction ability blocks a number of damage instances, regardless of the amount of damage those instances would cause."

		"dota_tip_hero_tidehunter_1"		"Tidehunter's Kraken Shell ability makes it very hard to prevent him from using Ravage, since dealing enough damage to him will trigger a Strong Dispel, removing stuns and most other disables from him."

		"dota_tip_hero_tinker_1"			"Tinker's Heat Seeking Missiles will only lock onto targets that Tinker has vision of when casting them. Running into the fog of war will not disjoint them."

		"dota_tip_hero_tiny_2"				"Tiny's Toss will interrupt channeling abilities, even those cast by allied heroes."
		"dota_tip_hero_tiny_3"				"The splash damage from Tiny's Tree Grab is physical damage, which is mitigated with armor and damage block."
		"dota_tip_hero_tiny_4"				"Early in the game, Tiny often deals a very lethal amount of magic damage, which can be mitigated by carrying Infused Raindrops."
		"dota_tip_hero_tiny_5"				"Late in the game, Tiny's sudden damage bursts can be prevented with an Aeon Disk."
		"dota_tip_hero_tiny_6"				"Tiny has very slow attack speed and relies on items and attack speed buffs from allies to keep his damage output high."

		"dota_tip_hero_troll_warlord_1"		"Troll Warlord's Fervor does not gain stacks when his attacks are evaded, making evasion an effective way of slowing down his damage output."

		"dota_tip_hero_tusk_1"				"Tusk's Snowball deals extra damage for each hero inside it."

		"dota_tip_hero_undying_1"			"Undying's Tombstone does not spawn zombies for nearby invisible units, and existing zombies will expire if the unit they are tracking becomes invisible."

		"dota_tip_hero_ursa_1"				"Ursa's Fury Swipes causes each of his attacks on the same target to deal more damage than the previous attack. This also works against Roshan, but does not work against structures."

		"dota_tip_hero_vengeful_spirit_2"	"Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap interrupts channeling spells on allies as well as enemies."

		"dota_tip_hero_viper_1"				"Viper's Viper Strike causes Break on affected targets, which disables passive abilities. This can be very effective against heroes like Bristleback."

		"dota_tip_hero_visage_1"			"Visage's Gravekeeper's Cloak ability decreases in effectiveness as players damage Visage but will quickly regenerate. Gravekeeper's Cloak also affects Visage's familiars."
		"dota_tip_hero_visage_3"			"Visage's Grave Chill also grants attack speed and movement speed bonuses to nearby familiars."
		"dota_tip_hero_visage_4"			"Visage's familiars can destroy trees by casting Stone Form above a tree."

		"dota_tip_hero_warlock_1"			"Warlock's Fatal Bonds ability causes damage on the victims to be shared, regardless of the distance between the victims."

		"dota_tip_hero_weaver_1"			"Beetles from Weaver's The Swarm deal physical damage, that can be mitigated with armor, but not with evasion or damage block."

		"dota_tip_hero_windrunner_1" 		"Windranger can choose not to attack her Focus Fire target, by attacking a different target or by issuing a stop command."

		"dota_tip_hero_winter_wyvern_1"		"Winter Wyvern's Splinter Blast shards will hit invisible units as well as units in the fog of war."
		"dota_tip_hero_winter_wyvern_2"		"Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse prevents affected enemies from taking damage from anyone except Winter Wyvern and her controlled units."

		"dota_tip_hero_wisp_1"				"While Io is tethered to an ally, it moves at the same speed as that ally."

		"dota_tip_hero_zuus_1"				"Zeus' Lightning Bolt can be cast on the ground to reveal nearby invisible units, including wards."
